        <ol>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ol>
       <h2>Directions</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. 
            Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. 
            When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. 
            Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.
        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. 
            It should take at least 5 minutes per side. 
            If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping..
        </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
