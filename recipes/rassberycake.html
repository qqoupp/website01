    <ul>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks or 8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 light brown sugar, packed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
      <li>/2 teaspoon pure lemon extract (optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla ex<tract</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 and 1/2 cups cake flour</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>/2 cup full-fat sour cream</li>
      <li>/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>
      <li>
        2 and 1/2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries, if using frozen, do not thaw
        first
      </li>
      <li>tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F). Cut out two 9-inch round segments of
        parchment paper to line your cake pans with. Spray each pan generously -
        sides and bottom - with nonstick cooking spray, then place the parchment
        paper cut out in the bottom of the pans and spray again. It's important
        to make sure every bit of pan and paper are sprayed so your cakes don't
        get stuck. Set pans aside.
      </p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>
        In a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer (or in the bowl of a
        stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment), combine the butter, both
        sugars, lemon zest, lemon extract, and vanilla extract; beat on medium
        speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until light and
        fluffy, about 5 minutes (don't skimp on time here!). Add in the eggs,
        one at a time, beating well after each addition, and scraping down the
        sides of the bowl as needed. Set aside.
      </p>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, baking
        soda and salt, mixing well to evenly combine the ingredients. Add the
        dry mixture into the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until
        everything is just barely combined. You should still see some lumps and
        dry streaks. Turn mixer off. Add in the milk, sour cream, and lemon
        juice; use a rubber spatula to fold the ingredients into the mixture,
        stirring until everything is incorporated, but being sure not to
        overmix. Set aside.
      </p>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>
        In another bowl, gently toss the raspberries with 2 tablespoons of
        all-purpose flour. Add the raspberries, and any remaining flour, to the
        batter and fold in by hand, using a rubber spatula, until just combined.
        Again, be sure not to over mix! Over mixing is very easy to do, and will
        result in a dry, dense cake.
      </p>
      <li>Step 5</li>
      <p>
        Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans and bake for 35 to 40
        minutes, or until the tops are firm and slightly golden, and a cake
        tester (or toothpick) inserted in the center comes out clean, or with a
        few moist (but not wet) crumbs clinging to it.
      </p>
      <li>Step 6</li>
      <p>
        Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before gently running
        a knife around the edges to loosen any stuck bits, then turning them out
        onto a cooling rack to cool
      </p>
      <li>Step 7</li>
      <p>While the cakes cool, you can make the frosting.</p>
